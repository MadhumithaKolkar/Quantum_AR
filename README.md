# Quantum_AR


## Overview
Quantum_AR is an augmented reality (AR) application that overlays digital content onto live camera feeds in real-time. Using computer vision techniques, this project detects keypoints in an input image, matches them with keypoints in a live camera feed, and seamlessly integrates digital augmentations into the real-world scene. It offers an immersive AR experience by combining feature detection, feature matching, and perspective transformation to align digital content with physical surfaces.

## Features
- Real-time augmented reality overlay
- Feature detection using ORB algorithm
- Feature matching using FLANN-based matcher
- Perspective transformation and augmentation

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Quantum_AR.git
   
Install dependencies:

>>> pip install opencv-python

Usage
- Place your input image as The_kid_who_came_from_space_Camera.jpg and your augmentation image as mask.jpg in the project directory.
- Run Augmentation.py
- Point your camera towards a scene to see the augmented reality overlay in action.
